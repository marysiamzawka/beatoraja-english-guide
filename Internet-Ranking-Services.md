Beatoraja supports usage of several different Internet Rankings, which allow submission of scores and also provide additional IR specific features. 
- Currently scores can be sent to several services at the same time, with one of them set as a main IR.
- Main IR adds certain features to the music select and is the one used for viewing chart pages after pressing `F11`
- All IRs BAN accounts for playing illegal BMS. 

## [Mocha-Repository](https://mocha-repository.info)
The most populated IR, only available bundled with the compiled releases.
It has rival support, settable course clear badges and LEVEL REVIEW system.
Following features are available when mocha is set as the main IR.

### LEVEL REVIEW
A feature allowing players to declare the difficulty and comment on the charts they've played, similarly to the popular [STATISTIK](http://statistik.benhgreen.com/IIDX/ratings) IIDX website.
Those ratings are then averaged and compiled into LEVEL REVIEW [difficulty table](Difficulty-Tables) for 7 KEY and 14 KEY modes, accessible from the music select.

### Collections
Some users can create collections and courses which others can subscribe to via the mocha website, which adds those folders to the music select.

## [MinIR](https://www.gaftalk.com/minir/)
Main unique feature of this IR is Unique ID which can be used to bind the profile with [Stellaway](https://lite.stellabms.xyz/#/stellaway/beatoraja) of Satellite and Stella difficulty tables.
- As a main IR it pushes the Satellite and Stella difficulty tables to your client, so it's best to not have them in your table list as it will duplicate them.
- Other unique feature are user created scoring contests of varied lengths.
- Has rival and course support

## [CitrusIR](https://citrus-ir.iidx.app/)
Another early IR implementation. No specific features when set as the main IR.
