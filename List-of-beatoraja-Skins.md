This page lists beatoraja-specific skins.

**Note:** You can mix and match skins. The skin is chosen separately for each menu type.
- For example, not many skins support the Course Result screen, so it might be worth picking up one of the skins that supports it just for the Course Result screen.

To search for skins for a specific menu, you can search for the menu type with Ctrl+F (e.g. Music Select, Decide, Result, Play, 7Keys, 9Keys, Course Result).

Not all of the skins listed have screenshots. That is because the author did not provide screenshots, and I am too lazy to take screenshots on my own. If anyone has tried those skins, it would be nice if you could contribute some screenshots.

## EndlessCirculation patch
I have not tested this. Endless Circulation Self Evolution (ECSE) is a popular LR2 skin. This is a patch that supposedly makes the skin work with beatoraja.

# Lunatic Rave 2 Skins

beatoraja supports the skin format used by LR2, which means that in theory, LR2 skins should work in beatoraja. However, there are many compatibility issues with LR2 skins when using them in beatoraja.

Generally, play skins should have less compatibility issues than music select skins.
